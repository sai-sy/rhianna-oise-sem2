[{"content":" About # Teaching, to me, is not just about delivering curriculum.\nIt is about building spaces where students feel seen, safe, and capable of becoming more than they thought they could be.\nThis portfolio represents my journey as a developing educator. It is a collection of lessons, reflections, and learning experiences that show how my teacher identity is being shaped through practice, research, and relationships with students. Each artefact reflects moments where I have learned to listen more carefully, teach more intentionally, and design learning that honours the diverse identities, strengths, and stories students bring into the classroom.\nI am especially interested in teaching that is rooted in equity, creativity, and emotional safety. My background in visual arts, dance, and critical inquiry informs how I approach learning , as something that should be expressive, collaborative, and meaningful rather than rigid or one-size-fits-all. I believe students learn best when they feel respected, when their voices matter, and when they are invited to participate in building their classroom community.\nThis portfolio is organized around Professionalism, Diversity and Equity, Curriculum and Learners, Assessment and Instruction, Classroom Management, and Community Involvement. Together, these sections tell the story of how I am learning to become the kind of teacher I once needed . One who teaches with care, intention, and a deep belief in every child’s potential.\nThank you for taking the time to explore my work.\nPedagogy: # My pedagogy is rooted in adaptability, creativity, and deep respect for students as individuals. I believe that learning is most powerful when it is student driven, when children are not simply receiving information but actively shaping their learning through questions, collaboration, and meaningful choice. Rather than viewing curriculum as a rigid script, I see it as a flexible framework that can be brought to life in ways that reflect students’ interests, identities, and ways of knowing.\nAn arts based approach is central to how I teach. Through visual art, movement, storytelling, and creative expression, students are able to think, communicate, and demonstrate understanding in ways that go beyond words alone. The arts open space for emotion, imagination, and multiple perspectives, making learning more accessible and more human. This is especially important for students who may struggle in traditional academic settings but thrive when given alternative ways to show what they know.\nMy teaching is also grounded in accommodation and personalization. Every classroom contains learners with different strengths, needs, and experiences, and I see it as my responsibility to design learning that responds to those differences rather than expecting students to conform to a single standard. By offering multiple entry points, flexible pathways, and supportive structures, I work to ensure that all students feel capable, valued, and included in the learning process. Ultimately, my pedagogy is about creating learning spaces where students feel safe to take risks, express themselves, and grow academically, socially, and emotionally.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":" Assessment, Planning, and Instruction # In this section, I showcase how I design, implement, and adjust instruction to meet the diverse needs of learners. Through lesson and unit planning, formative and summative assessment, and reflective practice, I strive to create learning experiences that are engaging, meaningful, and aligned with curriculum expectations. The artefacts in this section demonstrate how I use student work, feedback from mentor teachers, and research-informed strategies to plan lessons that support understanding, skill development, and critical thinking.\nArtefact 1: Grade 2 Math Units (Addition, Subtraction, and Data Management) # This artefact represents the Grade 2 math units I taught during my practicum, focusing on addition/subtraction, and data management. These units included lessons on number strategies, problem solving, and collecting and representing data. The lessons were taught over multiple days and were continuously adjusted based on student understanding and the feedback I received from my Associate Teacher. How it happened was through daily lesson planning, teaching, observing student work, and meeting with my AT to reflect on what was working and what needed to change. The players involved were the students, my AT, and myself. The most significant part of this experience was learning how professional teaching involves constant adjustment rather than sticking rigidly to a plan.\nArtefact 2: Treaties and Land-Based Learning Unit Plan # This artefact represents a unit plan on Treaties and Land-Based Learning that I created in collaboration with a small group during my Anti-Discriminatory Education course. The unit focused on helping students understand the history and significance of treaties in Canada, Indigenous relationships to land, and the ongoing importance of reconciliation. The lessons incorporated discussions, storytelling, hands-on land-based activities, reflective exercises, and a field trip to engage students in meaningful learning. How it happened was through collaborative planning meetings with my group members, where we divided research, shared ideas, and aligned our lessons with Ontario Social Studies curriculum expectations. The players involved were my peers, myself, and guidance from our instructor and Indigenous resources that informed the unit. The most significant part of this experience was designing a sequence of lessons that integrated inquiry, reflection, and experiential learning, while being careful to treat Indigenous knowledge with respect and authenticity.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1x7FvSoxopdkN44TdnkI1z1hX_TXrZtKdjTp8Y1jomGw/edit?usp=sharing\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/assessment-planning-and-instruction/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":" Classroom Management # This section highlights my approach to creating a safe, structured, and supportive classroom environment. It focuses on strategies that promote student independence, engagement, and self-regulation while maintaining a positive learning atmosphere. The artefact included demonstrating how I use proactive tools, routines, and technology to guide student behaviour, encourage responsibility, and foster a respectful classroom culture.\nArtefact 1: Using https://bouncyballs.org/ for Noise Level Management # This artefact represents my use of the website Bouncy Balls during my practicum placement to help students monitor and manage their own noise levels during indoor work time. Bouncy Balls is a visual tool that uses the classroom microphone to detect sound, and the louder the room becomes, the more the balls bounce around on the screen. When the noise level becomes too high, the site also gives reminders for students to quiet down. I used this tool during independent work periods and small group activities, when students were expected to work quietly. The players involved were the Grade 2 students and myself as the teacher. The most significant part of this experience was how quickly students began to regulate their own volume by watching the screen rather than relying on constant teacher reminders.

Classrooms are not neutral spaces. They are shaped by race, culture, religion, ability, language, and power. I believe it is the responsibility of educators to actively create learning environments where students feel seen, protected, and valued for who they are, not pressured to conform to a single dominant norm. In this section, I include artefacts that show how I design learning to challenge exclusion, honour difference, and support students whose identities have often been marginalized in schools. The artefacts in this section reflect my commitment to culturally responsive teaching, anti bias education, and inclusive classroom practices.\nArtefact 1: Skin Colour Misconceptions Lesson (Milk Colour Activity) # This artefact represents my lesson on skin colour and misconceptions, using the misconception of milk colours to help students understand how people can look different while still being the same inside. This lesson was created for a Grade 1 social studies context and was designed to challenge early stereotypes about skin tone in a way that was concrete and accessible for young children. The lesson is based on my own childhood misconception, where I believed that skin tone came from the type of milk I drank. This is used as a hook for students, showing chocolate and regular milk, to create a “science experiment” for students to investigate where skin tone comes from. Skin tone is then discussed by reading the book “Our Skin” to explain this concept at an age appropriate level.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNXkjLTCzUGG9dWWzey7wd4DSUJVgkZH/view?usp=sharing\nArtefact 2: Grade 5 Social Studies Lesson Plan # This artefact represents a Grade 5 Social Studies lesson plan I created that focused on helping students explore treaties such as Treaty 13, and creating their own class treaty. The lesson invited students to think critically about whose voices are heard, how people’s experiences differ, and how communities can be more inclusive. Students engaged in discussion, reflection, and activities that encouraged them to consider viewpoints beyond their own, and also see how similar their beliefs may be with their classmates. This lesson was created as part of my Anti-Discriminatory Education coursework and reflects how I planned to teach Social Studies through a lens of diversity and equity. The players involved were myself as the teacher and Grade 5 students as the intended learners. The most significant part of this lesson was its focus on helping students understand that social studies is not just about facts but about people, stories, and justice.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7SlYLVUKzQv5FNi4dqpThTIZp6zUPZk1PtaDMfzUm4/edit?usp=sharing\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/diversity-and-equity/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":" Involvement in School/Community Life # I understand teaching as work that extends beyond the classroom. Students do not arrive at school separated from their communities, and meaningful learning happens when educators build strong relationships with families, organizations, and the spaces where young people live and grow. My involvement with YouthInspired Foundation has especially shaped how I think about education as both an academic and a social responsibility. The artefacts in this section reflect how I engage with community based learning, youth advocacy, and mentorship to support students beyond traditional school structures.\nArtefact 1: YouthInspired Foundation and Victoria College Student Helpers # This artefact represents my involvement with the YouthInspired Foundation and Victoria College Student Helpers over the course of one year as a tutor and later as a director and member of the board of directors. The program is a free, one-on-one tutoring initiative that connects university students with K–12 learners from lower-income neighbourhoods across the GTA, providing academic support online at no cost. I began as a volunteer tutor, working directly with students to support their learning in subjects like literacy, math, and science. Later, I became a director of the program and served on the board, helping to formalize the organization as a registered charity. My responsibilities included creating the program’s website, organizing events, coordinating tutors and students, and ensuring the program ran smoothly outside of my own undergraduate studies. I even delivered a speech about the program at the Senate to promote its mission and advocate for equitable access to tutoring. The most significant part of this experience was witnessing how a well-run, accessible program could make a tangible difference in the lives of students who otherwise had limited academic support.\nArtefact 2: Supporting the Class Christmas Concert # This artefact represents my involvement in my Fall practicum class’s Christmas concert. I helped the students practice their performance during the school day and later attended the evening concert to support them, even though I had an important class of my own scheduled at the same time. The concert brought together students, families, and school staff in a shared celebration of learning and community. How it happened was through rehearsals in the classroom followed by the evening performance in the school gym. The players involved were the students, their families, classroom teachers, and myself. The most significant part of this experience was being present for the students as they performed and seeing how proud and excited they were to have familiar teachers in the audience.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/involvement-in-school-community-life/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":" Professionalism # For me, professionalism means designing learning that is thoughtful, ethical, and grounded in how children actually learn. It involves careful planning, attention to curriculum, and a responsibility to create learning environments that are both intellectually rich and emotionally safe. My experiences in practicum show how I approach teaching as a professional practice that balances structure with creativity and care. The artefacts in this section highlight how I translate Ontario curriculum expectations into meaningful, engaging learning for young students.\nArtefact 1: Professional Development Meeting on Literacy Interventions and UFLI # This artefact represents my participation in a professional development meeting during my Fall practicum that focused on literacy intervention and student identification practices within the Toronto Catholic District School Board. The session centered on how schools use data to determine which students require additional literacy support, with a particular focus on UFLI as a structured phonics based intervention program. The meeting took place during a scheduled PD block at my placement school and brought together classroom teachers, special education staff, and literacy leads. How it happened was through a collaborative staff meeting in which teachers reviewed student literacy data, discussed intervention criteria, and examined how UFLI was being implemented across grade levels. The players involved included classroom teachers, learning resource teachers, and school administrators who were responsible for coordinating intervention support. The most significant part of this experience was seeing how literacy decisions are made at a school wide level and how early intervention systems directly shape which students receive additional support and resources. I was also able to start sourcing my own interventions for my future classroom.\nArtefact 2: Parent Teacher Interviews and Conference Preparation Template # This artefact represents my participation in parent teacher interviews during my practicum and the conference preparation template shared with me to support those meetings. The template would be accompanied by students’ report cards (marks and comments), and samples of their work. My AT used this tool to organize information and prepare for meaningful, focused conversations about student progress. The interviews took place during scheduled interview evenings at my placement school, where families met with teachers to discuss their child’s learning. The players involved were the students’ parents or caregivers, my Associate Teacher, and myself. The most significant part of this experience was seeing how careful preparation helped make conversations more productive, respectful, and student centered.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/professionalism/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":" Understanding Curriculum and the Learner # I believe that effective teaching begins with understanding who students are, where they come from, and how they experience the world. Curriculum is not something that exists apart from learners. It takes meaning through their identities, cultures, interests, and communities. In this section, I highlight artefacts that show how I design learning by centering students’ lived experiences, local context, and diverse ways of knowing. The artefacts in this section reflect my commitment to responsive teaching that connects curriculum to real lives and real places.\nArtefact 1: Grade 2 Make Your Own Animal Science Unit # This artefact represents my Grade 2 science unit in which students designed their own animals based on what they learned about animal needs, habitats, and adaptations. The unit took place during my practicum placement and was taught over a series of lessons that explored how animals survive in different environments. Students learned about food, shelter, movement, and protection before creating an original animal that could live in a specific habitat. How it happened was through a combination of class discussions, videos, drawing, writing, and hands-on activities that allowed students to explore real animals and then apply their knowledge creatively. The players involved were the Grade 2 students, my mentor teacher, and myself as the teacher candidate. The most significant part of this experience was seeing how engaged students became when they were able to connect science content to something they genuinely loved, which was animals and imaginative creation. As a goodbye gift, I also made Pokémon style cards for each student featuring their invented animal. I created these because I knew how much the class loved Pokémon and collecting cards, and I wanted their science learning to feel personal and meaningful even after I left.\nArtefact 2: Madeline Hunter Lesson Plan for “Classroom Bingo” # This artefact represents the Madeline Hunter lesson plan I created and taught for a Social Studies activity called “Classroom Bingo.” The lesson focused on helping students learn about their classroom community by identifying classmates with different experiences, interests, and roles. Students moved around the room asking questions and filling in their bingo cards based on what they discovered about one another. This lesson took place during my practicum while I was teaching in a Grade 2 classroom. The players involved were my students and myself as the teacher. The most significant part of this experience was seeing how engaged the students were when learning about their classroom community through interaction rather than worksheets.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1anjwPJ0CMqoOMSZhnj_ILFk3ZICHiuPLnDqupci3TBo/edit?usp=sharing\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/understanding-curriculum-and-the-learner/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
