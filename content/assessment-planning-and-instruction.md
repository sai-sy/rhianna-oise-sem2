# Assessment, Planning, and Instruction

In this section, I showcase how I design, implement, and adjust instruction to meet the diverse needs of learners. Through lesson and unit planning, formative and summative assessment, and reflective practice, I strive to create learning experiences that are engaging, meaningful, and aligned with curriculum expectations. The artefacts in this section demonstrate how I use student work, feedback from mentor teachers, and research-informed strategies to plan lessons that support understanding, skill development, and critical thinking.

## Artefact 1: Grade 2 Math Units (Addition, Subtraction, and Data Management)

This artefact represents the Grade 2 math units I taught during my practicum, focusing on addition/subtraction, and data management. These units included lessons on number strategies, problem solving, and collecting and representing data. The lessons were taught over multiple days and were continuously adjusted based on student understanding and the feedback I received from my Associate Teacher.
How it happened was through daily lesson planning, teaching, observing student work, and meeting with my AT to reflect on what was working and what needed to change. The players involved were the students, my AT, and myself. The most significant part of this experience was learning how professional teaching involves constant adjustment rather than sticking rigidly to a plan.

## Artefact 2: Treaties and Land-Based Learning Unit Plan

This artefact represents a unit plan on Treaties and Land-Based Learning that I created in collaboration with a small group during my Anti-Discriminatory Education course. The unit focused on helping students understand the history and significance of treaties in Canada, Indigenous relationships to land, and the ongoing importance of reconciliation. The lessons incorporated discussions, storytelling, hands-on land-based activities, reflective exercises, and a field trip to engage students in meaningful learning.
How it happened was through collaborative planning meetings with my group members, where we divided research, shared ideas, and aligned our lessons with Ontario Social Studies curriculum expectations. The players involved were my peers, myself, and guidance from our instructor and Indigenous resources that informed the unit. The most significant part of this experience was designing a sequence of lessons that integrated inquiry, reflection, and experiential learning, while being careful to treat Indigenous knowledge with respect and authenticity.
