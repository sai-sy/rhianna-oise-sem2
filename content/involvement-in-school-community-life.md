# Involvement in School/Community Life

I understand teaching as work that extends beyond the classroom. Students do not arrive at school separated from their communities, and meaningful learning happens when educators build strong relationships with families, organizations, and the spaces where young people live and grow. My involvement with YouthInspired Foundation has especially shaped how I think about education as both an academic and a social responsibility.
The artefacts in this section reflect how I engage with community based learning, youth advocacy, and mentorship to support students beyond traditional school structures.

This artefact represents my involvement with the YouthInspired Foundation and Victoria College Student Helpers over the course of one year as a tutor and later as a director and member of the board of directors. The program is a free, one-on-one tutoring initiative that connects university students with K–12 learners from lower-income neighbourhoods across the GTA, providing academic support online at no cost.
I began as a volunteer tutor, working directly with students to support their learning in subjects like literacy, math, and science. Later, I became a director of the program and served on the board, helping to formalize the organization as a registered charity. My responsibilities included creating the program’s website, organizing events, coordinating tutors and students, and ensuring the program ran smoothly outside of my own undergraduate studies. I even delivered a speech about the program at the Senate to promote its mission and advocate for equitable access to tutoring. The most significant part of this experience was witnessing how a well-run, accessible program could make a tangible difference in the lives of students who otherwise had limited academic support.

## Artefact 2: Supporting the Class Christmas Concert

This artefact represents my involvement in my Fall practicum class’s Christmas concert. I helped the students practice their performance during the school day and later attended the evening concert to support them, even though I had an important class of my own scheduled at the same time. The concert brought together students, families, and school staff in a shared celebration of learning and community.
How it happened was through rehearsals in the classroom followed by the evening performance in the school gym. The players involved were the students, their families, classroom teachers, and myself. The most significant part of this experience was being present for the students as they performed and seeing how proud and excited they were to have familiar teachers in the audience.
