# About

Teaching, to me, is not just about delivering curriculum.

It is about building spaces where students feel seen, safe, and capable of becoming more than they thought they could be.

This portfolio represents my journey as a developing educator. It is a collection of lessons, reflections, and learning experiences that show how my teacher identity is being shaped through practice, research, and relationships with students. Each artefact reflects moments where I have learned to listen more carefully, teach more intentionally, and design learning that honours the diverse identities, strengths, and stories students bring into the classroom.

I am especially interested in teaching that is rooted in equity, creativity, and emotional safety. My background in visual arts, dance, and critical inquiry informs how I approach learning , as something that should be expressive, collaborative, and meaningful rather than rigid or one-size-fits-all. I believe students learn best when they feel respected, when their voices matter, and when they are invited to participate in building their classroom community.

This portfolio is organized around Professionalism, Diversity and Equity, Curriculum and Learners, Assessment and Instruction, Classroom Management, and Community Involvement. Together, these sections tell the story of how I am learning to become the kind of teacher I once needed . One who teaches with care, intention, and a deep belief in every child’s potential.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.

# Pedagogy:

My pedagogy is rooted in adaptability, creativity, and deep respect for students as individuals. I believe that learning is most powerful when it is student driven, when children are not simply receiving information but actively shaping their learning through questions, collaboration, and meaningful choice. Rather than viewing curriculum as a rigid script, I see it as a flexible framework that can be brought to life in ways that reflect students’ interests, identities, and ways of knowing.

An arts based approach is central to how I teach. Through visual art, movement, storytelling, and creative expression, students are able to think, communicate, and demonstrate understanding in ways that go beyond words alone. The arts open space for emotion, imagination, and multiple perspectives, making learning more accessible and more human. This is especially important for students who may struggle in traditional academic settings but thrive when given alternative ways to show what they know.

My teaching is also grounded in accommodation and personalization. Every classroom contains learners with different strengths, needs, and experiences, and I see it as my responsibility to design learning that responds to those differences rather than expecting students to conform to a single standard. By offering multiple entry points, flexible pathways, and supportive structures, I work to ensure that all students feel capable, valued, and included in the learning process.
Ultimately, my pedagogy is about creating learning spaces where students feel safe to take risks, express themselves, and grow academically, socially, and emotionally.
