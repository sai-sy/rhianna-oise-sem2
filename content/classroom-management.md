# Classroom Management
This section highlights my approach to creating a safe, structured, and supportive classroom environment. It focuses on strategies that promote student independence, engagement, and self-regulation while maintaining a positive learning atmosphere. The artefact included demonstrating how I use proactive tools, routines, and technology to guide student behaviour, encourage responsibility, and foster a respectful classroom culture.

## Artefact 1: Using https://bouncyballs.org/ for Noise Level Management

This artefact represents my use of the website Bouncy Balls during my practicum placement to help students monitor and manage their own noise levels during indoor work time. Bouncy Balls is a visual tool that uses the classroom microphone to detect sound, and the louder the room becomes, the more the balls bounce around on the screen. When the noise level becomes too high, the site also gives reminders for students to quiet down.
I used this tool during independent work periods and small group activities, when students were expected to work quietly. The players involved were the Grade 2 students and myself as the teacher. The most significant part of this experience was how quickly students began to regulate their own volume by watching the screen rather than relying on constant teacher reminders.
